			<strong>Courses I'm Taking, & Why:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>CIS-115-H150 Intro to Prog & Logic: I have taken this class before but wanted 
				to stay current with Python, since I do not have a Python class till next semester, I was afraid of losing what I have learned 
				so I am retaking to not feel behind..</li>
				<li>WEB-115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting: I have to take this class to graduate, but since I really grew to enjoy WEB 110 last fall, 
				I have been excited about taking this class.&nbsp;&#9885;&nbsp;<a href = "contract.html" target="_blank">Contract</a>&nbsp;&#9885;&nbsp;</li>
